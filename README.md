This project demonstrates Java OOP principles including inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
A base abstract class Animal is extended by various animal subclasses, each implementing specific interfaces (Walk and Swim) to define unique behaviors.
A console menu in Main.java allows the user to interact with each animal, set properties, and display behaviors.
